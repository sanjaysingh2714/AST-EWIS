# Aadhaar Societal Trends & Early-Warning Intelligence System (AST-EWIS)

## Problem Statement
Government agencies often analyze Aadhaar enrolment and update data retrospectively.
There is currently no proactive system to identify early signals of migration, exclusion,
or sudden demographic shifts.

## Solution Overview
AST-EWIS is a data-driven analytics system that analyzes Aadhaar enrolment and update
datasets to detect societal trends, anomalies, and early-warning indicators that can
support proactive governance and policy decision-making.

## Objectives
- Identify enrolment and update trends across regions and age groups
- Detect abnormal patterns indicating migration or exclusion
- Generate early-warning indicators for administrators
- Visualize insights using an interactive dashboard

## Datasets Used
- Aadhaar Enrolment Dataset
- Aadhaar Update Dataset
- Demographic Aggregated Dataset

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit

## Expected Impact
The system helps policymakers identify demographic shifts early and take data-driven
actions for improved service delivery and inclusion.
